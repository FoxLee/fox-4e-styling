# Fox's 4e Aesthetics for Foundry VTT has MOVED
Because I'm not okay with GitHub constantly advertising Microsoft's horrible "AI" service at me, not do I accept it digesting my work to further enrich its corporate overlords.
(I know the damage is already done, but sometime you gotta do stuff on principle.)

From now on, you can find us at https://codeberg.org/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/!

This repository will be archived soon and deleted as soon as is practical. The manifest should hopefully update automatically next time you run updates, but if it doesn't please use the new URL: https://codeberg.org/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/raw/branch/main/module.json

Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for understanding!
