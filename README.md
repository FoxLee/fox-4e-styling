## Features
### Core style NPC sheet
A new NPC sheet based on the official, deliciously compact 4e monster stat blocks we know and love!

* Specifically based on the MM3 style stat block, with action-based subheadings. (Note that the sheet uses its own power sorting mode, including sending powers with triggers to their own group.)
* Doesn't override the existing NPC sheet, so you can choose it per-monster or set it as the default, as you see fit.
* Retains the functionality of the existing sheet in almost all cases (some items have to be managed on a separate tab).
* Should work near-seamlessly with Draconas' [Foundry 4e Tools](https://github.com/draconas1/foundry-4e-tools)/[Masterplan exporter](https://github.com/draconas1/masterplan-json-export)
* Makes heavy use of "tooltip" messages to assist in editing.
* Every piece of visible text (aside from user entry of course) should be translation-ready.
* Auto-generated MM3 style power summary. No need to write your own summary, add extra info to headers or target lines, or any of that stuff. Just get the data right, and your summary should look perfect!

**Tips for Use**
* Power icons are not included because of dubious legality; the icon displayed is the image you set for the power. But if you use a light-coloured SVG for the power icon (recommended because it looks better on the chat card), it will turn black in the sheet summary. This only works for SVG filesâ€”oher files will be unchanged.
* Skills entry on the Main tab lists any skill which has a "base" value set, has any bonuses active, or has a total bonus higher than the corresponding raw ability check (configured on the "Manage" tab). **Exception:** Perception will never appear here since it's always in the header.
* Resistances/Immunities/Vulnerabilities entries in the header will show any damage type with a final value not equal to 0, or with "immunity" checked (configured on the "Manage" tab).
* Elite and Solo monsters will display Action Points and Saving Throws in the header. For everybody else, you can find them in the "Manage" tab if you need them.
* If "Advanced Math" is turned on, Ability Scores will appear for editing in the "Manage" tab, to avoid cluttering up the header.
* In the absence of a monster trait object in the current system build, the sheet collapses *almost* all Feats and Class/Race/Etc Features down into a single "Traits" section. The sole exception is Epic Destiny Features; to maintain continuity with Drac's import code, we're currently using the "destinyFeats" object to store monster lore in a chat-card-friendly format. Features of this type will appear on the Lore tab instead.
### Journal Styling
Makes your Journals look just like official 4e books!

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205657-7e8f3463-8add-4b76-9fc1-ca126761af6c.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205657-7e8f3463-8add-4b76-9fc1-ca126761af6c.png" width=150></a>
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205690-6199634a-23aa-4cfa-bbaf-c3749a1404bd.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205690-6199634a-23aa-4cfa-bbaf-c3749a1404bd.png" width=150></a>
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205715-4e35984f-77b4-4478-b04c-90f5ca55bd76.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198205715-4e35984f-77b4-4478-b04c-90f5ca55bd76.png" width=150></a>
* Should work for all ProseMirror-based rich text areas.
* Includes body text, headings, lists, tables, and whatever else I can manage.
* I haven't worked out how to include selectable styles yet, but you can use the HTML source editor to take advantage of built-in classes.
  * Check the included "Example Styling" compendium for how to markup game stuff in journals. Currently supports generic table, "power" (table), "item" (table), "ritual" (div) and "rules-block" (div). (Other styles will be forthcoming, and hopefully I can eventually work out how to make them front-end selectable.)
* I dunno how to add journal sheets, but you can toggle the styling package on/off from the module settings.
* Includes a selector so you can choose between book-accurate serif font, or the sans-serif version that's more easily readable on many screens.
### Chat Card Styling
Styles chat item cards to match the core 4e books.

* Turn it on/off in the module settings.
* **NEW:** Add text to the automatic tooltips for calculated values on chat cards, so you can check which attributes they include. For instructions on usage see the "New Features" in the included "Text Styling Examples" compendium.
* Chat cards for "destinyFeats" sent by NPC actors are styled after monster stat blocks, as per the workaround in use on the NPC character sheet.
* Recharge powers have monster header colour, since they almost always come from NPCs.
* I gave rituals a purple header cus, I dunno, I like it.
* If you're using auto-generated power cards, NPC power cards will have their flavour text automatically be toggled "hidden" in chat. Reasoning: unlike PC powers, using the chat flavour field to judge whether or not we need the full description is unreliable (because NPC powers almost never have flavour text).
* If you're not using auto-generated power cards, I've enabled two classes you can use with the source code editor to make the appropriate parts of your text pick up some basic styling.
  * `power-basics` for text that should look like the source/type/usage/keywords section
  * `flavour` for text that should look like flavour text. 
  * To use them, enter "source code" mode using the toolbar button in the text editor. Then just add the desired class name to the `p` or `div` element wrapping your text, like so: `<p class="flavour">`. You won't see any difference while editing your item (at least for now) but you should see it in chat next time you use the power.
  * They will probably look okay with some elements other than p or div too, but consider these "unsupported".
* Includes compatibility tweaks for: [Chat Portrait](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/chat-portrait), [Narrator Tools](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/narrator-tools), [DragonFlagon Chat Enhancements](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/df-chat-enhance), [Active Effects to Chat](https://github.com/BadIdeasBureau/ae-to-chat), [Condition Lab & Triggler](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/condition-lab-triggler) and [Simply Portraits](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/simply-portraits). Feel free to request others if you want themâ€”I'll do what I can!
### Token Action HUD Styling
Enhances 4e styling for [Token Action HUD Classic](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/token-action-hud) (requires [Foundry 4e Tools](https://github.com/draconas1/foundry-4e-tools)).

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198206272-96f3e1fd-7980-432b-8d8b-15c98d007aa8.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10067730/198206272-96f3e1fd-7980-432b-8d8b-15c98d007aa8.png" width=150></a>

* If you have "Colour Powers By Use Type" turned on, tweaks the colours to be book-accurate (matching chat cards and PC sheet).
* Tooltips with item cards will are styled similarly to chat cards. Unfortunately card styling is more generic than for chat, as there is less information available about what type of card is being displayed (for example, equipment and NPC powers lose their unique colour schemes).
* Turn it on/off from the module settings.

### Visual Active Effects Styling
Adds 4e styling for [Visual Active Effects](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/visual-active-effects) effects panel.
* Styles effect info much like chat cards, using the 4e gradient BG and text styles as in journals.
* Uses the maroon accent colour from GM books as a header colour.

### Extra chat styling
Extra chat styles have been moved into a new system-agnostic module, [Burble](https://github.com/FoxLee/Burble)!

### To-Do/In Progress
* New Player Character sheet. (This was actually *almost* complete when I finally worked out how to create a new sheet, so I'm in the process of redoing it.)
  * <strike>Won't be a drastic overhaul like the NPC sheet, but more of a core-book-themed reskin</strike>. Will be a drastic overhaul, because I saw the Pathfinder 2e sheet and I'm in love.
* New Sheets for all system "items" (powers, feats, gear, etc)
* Fix the new NPC sheet's power sorting method, for Token Action HUD. For now, load a layout preset from the "extras" folder.
