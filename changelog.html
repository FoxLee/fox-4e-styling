		<h1>Changelog</h1>
		
		<h2>2024-03-20: [0.16] Tooltip tweaks</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Introduced ability to add text to the automatic tooltips for calculated values on chat cards, so you can clearly note which values go into the calculation. For instructions on usage, please see the "New Features" article in the included "Text Styling Examples" compendium.</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Nicer styling for inline rolls in chat cards</li>
			<li>Changed the frontend name to make it clear the module is not limited to stylesheets.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2024-03-20: [0.15] Updated for 4e system v0.4.44</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Updated all styles to match the new classes in the v0.4.44 markup</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Added styling for the new buttons and effects panel</li>
			<li>[EX Chat Styles] Updated power card buttons to be dark in dark mode.</li>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Updated translation references and styling classes</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Added a new setting to update older chat messages so they don't drop styling info. If you have older chat message you don't want to delet yet, this setting should effectively "patch" them during rendering so they pick up the new styling. It won't be here forever, so please turn it off when you next clear your chat!</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2024-03-19: [0.14] Non-Auto chat card fix</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Fixed a bug where certain paragraphs were not styled properly if using manual markup. (Thanks Aerk!)</li>
			<li>[EX Chat Styles] Made inclusion of EX chat styles programmatically dependent on basic chat styles. Ideally the checkbox would be disabled if basic chat styles are off too, but I don't know how to do that quickly, and I wanted this fix out quick.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2024-03-18: [0.13] Various Small Fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Fixed skill input field colouring in dark mode.</li>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Fixed unwanted text wrapping in some header values.</li>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Removed unwanted margins on portrait.</li>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Fixed a bug where skills with a +0 modifier would appear in the main summary if the ability score mod was &lt;0.</li>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Fixed faulty reference to leader toggle tooltip.</li>
			<li>[Journals] Fixed text colour in rules-block elements under dark mode.</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Updated PC power card visuals to more closely match the last official design, where entries above the attack/target line are white, and later fields alternate between white and gradient. (Will not be fully active until the system updates.)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2024-03-17: [0.12] Chat Style Updates</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Minor fixes here and there, including an issue where unexpected markup was preventing NPC feature chat cards from applying backgrounds properly.</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Added compatibility with Active Effects to Chat module.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-12-13: [0.11] Item Card Updates</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Updated power cards for items (game objects that are weapons, equipment, tools, backpacks, consumables or powers with Usage&gt;Item) to match the styling used in later books (Mordenkainen's) and some later Dragon Magazines. I wasn't sure whether to use this style or the original&mdash;both are used often by the late 4e era&mdash;but ultimately I decided to go with the peach-coloured one because it involves less stark white, and therefore goes better with both light and dark mode UI.</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Updated power cards for NPC traits and powers to follow their sheet style.</li>
			<li>In both of the above cases, auto output is not an exact match; I can't do that without overriding the chat card template, which I would like to do but haven't worked out yet. However, with a little custom markup, the non-auto output can be basically perfect. To this end I have implemented "basics" and "subheading" classes for these chat cards, and a new compendium of Item Styling Examples. Please check their description fields in "Source HTML" mode if you want to use these styles!</li>
			<li>[Chat Styles] Updated loot cards to use the header colour from treasure parcels. I thought it might be a good idea to differentiate them from mechanically useful items, and the maroon from treasure parcels is pleasantly distinct.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>2023-12-03: [0.10.7] Skill Training Update</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>[NPC Sheet] Updated to work with improved skill training handling.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>2023-10-29: [0.10.6] NPC flavour fix</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed flavour/description handling on NPC chat cards.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>2023-10-22: [0.10.5] Enhanced Dark Mode Compatibility &amp; Small Fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a styling issue that caused buttons added to the sidebar by some modules to appear way too big. (Thanks Drac!)</li>
			<li>(NPC Sheet) Fixed some colours that were wrong under Dark Mode, and refined the button styling a bit.</li>
			<li>(Chat Styles) Improved styling after core template updates.</li>
			<li>(Chat Styles) Fixed an issue where paragraphs inside tables looked butt ugly in power card text. (Thanks drywallmud!)</li>
			<li>(Journal Styles) Enhanced dark mode support by spreading dark styles to editor areas (journals, description fields etc.). Changes are minimal&mdash;just a couple of colours adjusted to be readable on the dark BG&mdash;and inline game items/tables are left as is. I don't love the colours and may change them at a later date, but they will do for now.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>2023-10-18: [0.10.4] Dark Mode Compatibility</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Minor styling &amp; code revisions to accommodate new dark mode in system core. For now this just means making everything legible; I may add a book-inspired dark set of styles at a later date, as the contrast between dark mode and pure white journal pages is pretty violent.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-09-24: [0.10.3] Enhancements &amp; Integration</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Updated html to use data-tooltip instead of title.</li>
			<li>(Chat EX) Added new styling for ongoing damage reports.</li>
			<li>(Chat EX) Added new styling to play nice with Chat Commander/DF Chat Enhancements.</li>
			<li>(NPC Sheet) Copied over new "show image" button that EndlessNights added to the default sheet.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-07-17: [0.10.2] Various Small Fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Included compendia will now be distributed in the new database format. (Oh dear. Wish me luck.)</li>
			<li>Added permissions for included compendia.</li>
			<li>Updated all SVG files to have explicit sizes, to prevent a potential issue in Firefox browsers.</li>
			<li>(NPC sheet) Updated a reference to effect.label to effect.name, fixing a console warning under v11.</li>
			<li>(NPC sheet) Added "Saving Throw" to the right hand header column standard/minion/other sheet. It's not book-accurate, but it does allow saves to be rolled for such creatures without navigating to the "Manage" tab, which is a lot more convenient for those not using something like Token Action HUD.</li>
			<li>(NPC sheet) Cleaned up the markup (shouldn't be noticeable on the front end) and fixed a non-translatable string in one of the field titles.</li>
			<li>(Chat EX) Fixed a bug where dice results in chat cards were clipped at the top, and didn't display the icon indicator.</li>
			<li>(Token Action HUD) Fixed an issue where main buttons appeard with wrong height when using TAH's default style setting. (Thanks Draconas!).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-06-06: [0.10.0] v11 Compatibility</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Tested up to FVTT v11.300 and dnd4e v0.4.2. I could find no issues, but please report anything you find!</li>
			<li>Aside from automatic compendium updates the the new format, I also added some more examples to the journal styling compendium, specifically for power markup.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2023-05-31: [0.9.47] Whisper fix &amp; Australian English</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>(Chat EX) Fixes an issue where I accidentally made names in whispers unreadably pale.</li>
			<li>(Chat EX) Improved styling for Item Piles item lists.</li>
			<li>Adds support for en-AU language setting (should suffice for en-GB as well).</li>
			<li>Changed default English language file to use US English, as per Foundry standard (bah).</li>
			<li><strong>No v11 update yet.</strong> I will only update things for v11 once the 4e system is updated.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-04-21: [0.9.45] Just pretend I did it right</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an error where I failed to make the flavour hiding behaviour depend on auto-generate.</li>
			<li>Added the changelog.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>2023-05-05: [0.9.46] Rollable Tables &amp; Item Piles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an issue with Chat EX styling making rollable table output unreadable.</li>
			<li>Added support for using Chat EX styles with Item Piles module.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-04-21: [0.9.45] Just pretend I did it right</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an error where I failed to make the flavour hiding behaviour depend on auto-generate.</li>
			<li>Added the changelog.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-03-24: [0.9.44] Visual optimisations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the chat.js scripts file to handle auto-collapse of NPC chat card flavour.</li>
			<li>Resistances area on the NPC sheet no longer takes up space while empty. This should make simple monsters a bit more compact.</li>
			<li>Since my &quot;don&#39;t output flavour for auto-generated NPC chat cards&quot; logic was reverted in the system module, I&#39;ve replaced it with a simple bit of logic to collapse the flavour area on NPC chat cards by default.</li>
			<li>Added classes to the containing div for the Resistances area, so we can tell when it&#39;s empty, and what type of content it has when full. (Used primarily for hiding the area when empty.)<ul>
				<li>ATM this outputs the class once for every instance it finds in the resistances array, which is less than ideal, but does work. Maybe at some stage I&#39;ll come up with an elegant way to avoid it, but the only ways I can think of right now would massively overcomplicate the template code, so I don&#39;t wanna.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-03-17: [0.9.43] Condition/special resistances</h2>
		<p>Allows user management of condition &amp; special resistances. Up until now these have been visible but not editable, so you could only add them by updating a creature&#39;s JSON via import. Now you can manage them on-sheet, like you&#39;d expect.</p><p>Note this behaviour depends on the base system update to do the same, so it will only work correctly if you&#39;re running DnD4e 0.3.24 or later&mdash;but it should also fail harmlessly on earlier versions.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-03-08: [0.9.42] French translation</h2>
		<p>Contains a new French translation contributed by <a href=""https://github.com/Gilphe">Gilphe</a>, as well as a minor (generally invisible) update to the NPC sheet.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-26: [0.9.41] Styling Examples</h2>
		<p>Starting to add table styling so you can easily inline blocks for things like magic items, rituals and so forth. Not yet complete (currently includes a div for ritual and a table for item in addition to the rules block that was already available). Also styles the default table in the journal to match 4e books.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-25: [0.9.40] Journal styling fixes</h2>
		<p>Minor fix; correctly applies sans-serif font to tables and rules blocks.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-18: [0.9.39] Improved error handling, tidiness, compatibility</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/issues/16&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324990877&amp;usg=AOvVaw314SEb55K7TB1K22OEPXfO">#16</a>&nbsp;by adding error handling for unevaluable attack formulae</li>
			<li>Fixes <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/issues/15&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324991407&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iRlJsgrjbdevVl1mCO11u">#15</a>&nbsp;by adding a clause avoid applying speech bubble styling to narrator dialogues under EX Chat styles</li><li>Improved EX Chat styles to not add the &quot;speechmaker&quot; element to dialogues when it&#39;s not turn on</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-12027: [0.9.38] Improved power summaries</h2>
		<p>Improved handling of auto-generated power summaries; now bypasses &quot;description&quot; field for auto-generated cards, even if &quot;Chat Message Text&quot; is present.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-28: [0.9.36] Improved chat cards and roll dialogues</h2>
		<p>Improved chat card output:&nbsp;Tweaked to suit proposed chat card markup changes to system core: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/254%23issue-1446783618&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324992428&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Xw0cMC0sN_ykyXBtcVKj0">EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta#254 (comment)</a>&nbsp;(specifically deals with auto-generated power cards vs arbitrary rich-text cards). WILL break chat card styling without the 4e system changes.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-05: [0.9.34] Missing miss fix</h2>
		<p>Fixed the missing &quot;miss&quot; entry in power descriptions, how did I miss that? It&#39;s a mystery. Thanks again to buttcheeksio!</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-12: [0.9.35] Chat EX Styling fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an undesirable display quirk with probable hit/miss dialogue and long target names in chat roll dialogues. Thanks to Draconas and Milo for flagging/helping with this one!</li>
			<li>Also refined up the styling on the collapsible roll details so it looks a lot more intentional and a lot less &quot;good enough I guess&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-11-04: [0.9.33] Apple line-height fix</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes a font encoding issue that caused text to be offset from its proper baseline on Apple devices. Thanks to buttcheeksio for reporting this issue and helping to troubleshoot!</li>
			<li>Added a default width for the NPC sheet window, to suit the MM3 style display.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.32] Config fixes</h2>
		<p>Well that was predictable.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fix to setting journal font config refresh</li>
			<li>Changed all settings to client config. Why not let people choose?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.31] Now with config!</h2>
		<p>A fix to the extra chat CSS that I missed before uploading 0.9.3. Le sigh.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.3] Now with config!</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>With the help of Draconas and the Foundry Discord, I finally learned how to make stuff configurable! Now you can load each styling package individually, so you won&#39;t be stuck with my chat or journal styling if you only want the sheets!</li>
			<li>On Drac&#39;s request, I&#39;ve added the ability to select a sans-serif font (the same one used by the monster sheet and power cards) for the base font in journals. Give it a try if you&#39;re finding the book-accurate journal text hard/unpleasant to read :)</li>
			<li>Completed styling for all types of chat cards (I had concentrated mostly on powers at first). I&#39;d eventually like to override the normal chat cards for a higher level of customisation, but for now most things look quite good, and nothing looks upsettingly bad.<ul>
				<li>Includes styling Destiny Features that comes from NPC actors to evoke monster blocks!</li>
				<li>I gave recharge powers the monster header colour, since in almost all cases they are limited to NPCs</li>
				<li>I did the best I could with the ritual card. I won&#39;t be able to make it accurate until I get to doing overrides.</li>
			</ul>	</li>
			<li>Included a new stylesheet for &quot;extra&quot; chat styles. They&#39;re not based on any books, I just like them :p</li><li>Now requires 4e system 0.3.14 at minimum, as that facilitates the chat cards.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-29: [0.9.2] Further small fixes</h2>
		<p>A few minor fixes, mostly visual</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Required 4e system version should now actually be required</li>
			<li>Chat styling: Should now be compatible with Chat Portraits module</li>
			<li>NPC sheet: Fixed visual issue where spacing would appear in the header immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities section even when subsections were hidden</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-28: [0.9.1] Day one patch :p</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes problems with usage section in power summaries:<ul>
				<li>Correct &quot;usage per&quot; label now displayed</li>
				<li>Remaining usage value can now be updated from the power summary</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Adds a minimum version requirement for the 4e system</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Shouts out to wigmeister2000 and Finbar for finding issues, thanks folks!</p>
		
		<h2>2022-10-27: [0.9] Monster Sheet express</h2>
		<p>We&#39;re not exactly finished and need some testing. But folks were enthused about the new monster sheet so I wanted to get a usable release out the door!</p>
