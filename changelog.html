		<h1>Changelog</h1>

		<h2>2023-05-05: [0.9.46] Rollable Tables &amp; Item Piles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an issue with Chat EX styling making rollable table output unreadable.</li>
			<li>Added support for using Chat EX styles with Item Piles module.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-04-21: [0.9.45] Just pretend I did it right</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an error where I failed to make the flavour hiding behaviour depend on auto-generate.</li>
			<li>Added the changelog.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-03-24: [0.9.44] Visual optimisations</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Added the chat.js scripts file to handle auto-collapse of NPC chat card flavour.</li>
			<li>Resistances area on the NPC sheet no longer takes up space while empty. This should make simple monsters a bit more compact.</li>
			<li>Since my &quot;don&#39;t output flavour for auto-generated NPC chat cards&quot; logic was reverted in the system module, I&#39;ve replaced it with a simple bit of logic to collapse the flavour area on NPC chat cards by default.</li>
			<li>Added classes to the containing div for the Resistances area, so we can tell when it&#39;s empty, and what type of content it has when full. (Used primarily for hiding the area when empty.)<ul>
				<li>ATM this outputs the class once for every instance it finds in the resistances array, which is less than ideal, but does work. Maybe at some stage I&#39;ll come up with an elegant way to avoid it, but the only ways I can think of right now would massively overcomplicate the template code, so I don&#39;t wanna.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2023-03-17: [0.9.43] Condition/special resistances</h2>
		<p>Allows user management of condition &amp; special resistances. Up until now these have been visible but not editable, so you could only add them by updating a creature&#39;s JSON via import. Now you can manage them on-sheet, like you&#39;d expect.</p><p>Note this behaviour depends on the base system update to do the same, so it will only work correctly if you&#39;re running DnD4e 0.3.24 or later&mdash;but it should also fail harmlessly on earlier versions.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-03-08: [0.9.42] French translation</h2>
		<p>Contains a new French translation contributed by Gliphe, as well as a minor (generally invisible) update to the NPC sheet.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-26: [0.9.41] Styling Examples</h2>
		<p>Starting to add table styling so you can easily inline blocks for things like magic items, rituals and so forth. Not yet complete (currently includes a div for ritual and a table for item in addition to the rules block that was already available). Also styles the default table in the journal to match 4e books.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-25: [0.9.40] Journal styling fixes</h2>
		<p>Minor fix; correctly applies sans-serif font to tables and rules blocks.</p>
		
		<h2>2023-02-18: [0.9.39] Improved error handling, tidiness, compatibility</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/issues/16&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324990877&amp;usg=AOvVaw314SEb55K7TB1K22OEPXfO">#16</a>&nbsp;by adding error handling for unevaluable attack formulae</li>
			<li>Fixes <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/FoxLee/fox-4e-styling/issues/15&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324991407&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iRlJsgrjbdevVl1mCO11u">#15</a>&nbsp;by adding a clause avoid applying speech bubble styling to narrator dialogues under EX Chat styles</li><li>Improved EX Chat styles to not add the &quot;speechmaker&quot; element to dialogues when it&#39;s not turn on</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-12027: [0.9.38] Improved power summaries</h2>
		<p>Improved handling of auto-generated power summaries; now bypasses &quot;description&quot; field for auto-generated cards, even if &quot;Chat Message Text&quot; is present.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-28: [0.9.36] Improved chat cards and roll dialogues</h2>
		<p>Improved chat card output:&nbsp;Tweaked to suit proposed chat card markup changes to system core: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta/pull/254%23issue-1446783618&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1680308324992428&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Xw0cMC0sN_ykyXBtcVKj0">EndlesNights/dnd4eBeta#254 (comment)</a>&nbsp;(specifically deals with auto-generated power cards vs arbitrary rich-text cards). WILL break chat card styling without the 4e system changes.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-05: [0.9.34] Missing miss fix</h2>
		<p>Fixed the missing &quot;miss&quot; entry in power descriptions, how did I miss that? It&#39;s a mystery. Thanks again to buttcheeksio!</p>
		
		<h2>2022-11-12: [0.9.35] Chat EX Styling fixes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes an undesirable display quirk with probable hit/miss dialogue and long target names in chat roll dialogues. Thanks to Draconas and Milo for flagging/helping with this one!</li>
			<li>Also refined up the styling on the collapsible roll details so it looks a lot more intentional and a lot less &quot;good enough I guess&quot;.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-11-04: [0.9.33] Apple line-height fix</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes a font encoding issue that caused text to be offset from its proper baseline on Apple devices. Thanks to buttcheeksio for reporting this issue and helping to troubleshoot!</li>
			<li>Added a default width for the NPC sheet window, to suit the MM3 style display.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.32] Config fixes</h2>
		<p>Well that was predictable.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fix to setting journal font config refresh</li>
			<li>Changed all settings to client config. Why not let people choose?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.31] Now with config!</h2>
		<p>A fix to the extra chat CSS that I missed before uploading 0.9.3. Le sigh.</p>
		
		<h2>2022-10-30: [0.9.3] Now with config!</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>With the help of Draconas and the Foundry Discord, I finally learned how to make stuff configurable! Now you can load each styling package individually, so you won&#39;t be stuck with my chat or journal styling if you only want the sheets!</li>
			<li>On Drac&#39;s request, I&#39;ve added the ability to select a sans-serif font (the same one used by the monster sheet and power cards) for the base font in journals. Give it a try if you&#39;re finding the book-accurate journal text hard/unpleasant to read :)</li>
			<li>Completed styling for all types of chat cards (I had concentrated mostly on powers at first). I&#39;d eventually like to override the normal chat cards for a higher level of customisation, but for now most things look quite good, and nothing looks upsettingly bad.<ul>
				<li>Includes styling Destiny Features that comes from NPC actors to evoke monster blocks!</li>
				<li>I gave recharge powers the monster header colour, since in almost all cases they are limited to NPCs</li>
				<li>I did the best I could with the ritual card. I won&#39;t be able to make it accurate until I get to doing overrides.</li>
			</ul>	</li>
			<li>Included a new stylesheet for &quot;extra&quot; chat styles. They&#39;re not based on any books, I just like them :p</li><li>Now requires 4e system 0.3.14 at minimum, as that facilitates the chat cards.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-29: [0.9.2] Further small fixes</h2>
		<p>A few minor fixes, mostly visual</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Required 4e system version should now actually be required</li>
			<li>Chat styling: Should now be compatible with Chat Portraits module</li>
			<li>NPC sheet: Fixed visual issue where spacing would appear in the header immunities/resistances/vulnerabilities section even when subsections were hidden</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>2022-10-28: [0.9.1] Day one patch :p</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixes problems with usage section in power summaries:<ul>
				<li>Correct &quot;usage per&quot; label now displayed</li>
				<li>Remaining usage value can now be updated from the power summary</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Adds a minimum version requirement for the 4e system</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Shouts out to wigmeister2000 and Finbar for finding issues, thanks folks!</p>
		
		<h2>2022-10-27: [0.9] Monster Sheet express</h2>
		<p>We&#39;re not exactly finished and need some testing. But folks were enthused about the new monster sheet so I wanted to get a usable release out the door!</p>
